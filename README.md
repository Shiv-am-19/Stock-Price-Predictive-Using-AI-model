# Stock-Price-Predictive-Using-AI-model

Welcome to the Stock Price Predictive using AI Model repository! 📈
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models to predict future stock prices based on historical market data.
Our goal is to explore how artificial intelligence can enhance stock market forecasting and decision-making.

🚀 P**roject Overview**

Collect historical stock price data

Preprocess and engineer features from the data

Train machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Build deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, etc.)

Evaluate and compare model performance

Visualize predictions vs. actual stock prices

📦 **Features**

Data scraping from Yahoo Finance / APIs

Time series data preprocessing and analysis

AI models for price prediction

Performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)

Interactive visualizations of stock trends and predictions

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for ML models

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch for deep learning

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

yfinance for data collection

📊 **Example Output**

Historical vs Predicted stock price charts

Model evaluation reports

Trend analysis graphs

🧠 **Future Enhancements**

Incorporate news sentiment analysis for better prediction

Use Transformer-based models (like BERT for finance)

Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit
